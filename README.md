### Hello👋 I'm Guillermo Santiago

- 🚀I've been coding for over a year in Python and Javascript and recently graduated from [Code Platoon](https://www.codeplatoon.org/) 
- 📝I'm currently delving deeper into the Javascript ecosystem with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and working on personal projects.

 With each project, I become more and more fascinated with software development. I love working in Python with backend technologies, but I also like to keep my frontend skills sharp. I am seeking a role that allows me to expand my skill sets and contribute to exciting projects; if you're hiring, let's chat!
